## Android

While many social media sites fail to download assets properly, on Android you can use the intent link reliably to escape.

- ❌ Silent - Fails to download file without any indication to user.
- ❌ With note - Fails but provides some feedback to user.
- ❌ Opens file in default browser - Unexpected behavior. Continues to confuses user on how to download file.
- Intent link escape (opens link in default browser instead of in-app) - `intent:https://example.com#Intent;end`

### iOS

There is no reliable way to exit in-app browsers on iOS. **And even when a user is prompted to select a browser to open a given link from an app, Safari in the pared down SFSafariViewController provides a uniquely bad downloading experience.** The user is shown the file details via text but one must click on "More..." then scroll below the fold to "Save to image" to download the file. This bizarre behavior is captured on the first row of the table below.

- ❌ Silent - Fails to download file without any indication to user.
- ❌ Opens file in in-app browser - Provides no easy way to download
- ❌ Shows file, but have to... - You can technically download in this view after click ("More..."), scroll, click ("Save image" or file) in SFSafariViewController but the UX is exceedingly bad and not on-par with Safari or any other browser experience that I believe it doesn't fulfill the capabilities of what is expected from a web download link.
- Safari search link - `x-web-search://?site:example.com`
- Browser app link - In example Chrome: `googlechromes://example.com`
